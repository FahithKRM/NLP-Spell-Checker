# NLP-Spell-Checker
This Spelling Checker uses NLTK to provide a real-time spelling check in a Tkinter GUI. As users type, it highlights misspelled words in red, comparing against an English word corpus. The project promotes ease of use, dynamic feedback, and serves as a foundation for NLP applications.
